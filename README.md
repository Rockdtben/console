# console
console is an open-source network and programming simulation "game"
It was created in 2001 by Exadv1 as a sandbox to experiment with features he planned to implement into Space Station 13.
Over time the project grew as more people started tinkering with it.
It provides an environment where people can setup wired and wireless networks attached to various devices, and write programs to utilize these networks.
